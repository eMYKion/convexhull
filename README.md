# INCOMPLETE

# Convex Hull

## Usage:

```bash
$ make
$ ./a.out < input.txt
```

The input text file must be in the following format:

```
n
x1 y1
x2 y2
...
xn yn
```

`n` must be a positive integer.
`n` must be followed by n lines of points,
each line is the x-coordinate followed by a space, followed
by the y-coordinate. The x,y coordinates must be floating-point
numbers parsable by `scanf`.

For example, `input.txt` could be:

```
3
1 2
3 3.5
-1.4 5.6
```
